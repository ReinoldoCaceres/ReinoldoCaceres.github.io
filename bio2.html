                        Meet Dennis
                        Born and raised in Bellevue, WA (near Seattle), Dennis ventured to Southern California
                        to attend Azusa Pacific University in 1980 to play basketball and sing in the choir. After
                        graduating in 1984 with a degree in education, he began teaching full-time at Duarte
                        H.S. and working on his master's degree. In the mist of teaching, in 1985 he obtained his
                        real estate license with a friend and began working at Century-21 part-time. By 1987,
                        Dennis decided that real estate was where he was meant to be. He went full-time,
                        moving to Southland Properties in Glendora when they first opened that year, and later
                        became a broker.</p>

                <div class="red-line-v">
                    <p>Dennis has assisted nearly 500 hundred buyers & sellers primarily in the East San
                        Gabriel Valley, with Azusa being his most active and familiar city. In 2011, he took a
                        position at his alma mater, APU, in their Advancement Office, eventually serving as
                        Director of Gift and Estate Planning. In 2022, Dennis stepped away from APU to focus
                        on his role with the City of Azusa, and the decision to run for the same seat in
                        November. He is a member of the Azusa Rotary club and has previously served as a
                        club president, among other leadership roles in church, HOAs and club groups. Dennis
                        and Rhonda bought their first home in 1985 in Azusa and have owned property in the
                        city continuously since. They have lived in their current home in the Rosedale area
                        since 2013.</p>

            <p>Since I arrived in 1980, I have formed a special bond with the city of Azusa. It has become my home.
                Having
                attended college here, met my wife here, worked here, worshipped here, owned property here and raised
                our
                kids here in the community, my roots have grown deep. I love the history and diversity of our city and
                have
                always believed that Azusa is a beautiful city with even greater potential.</p>

            <h1>I believe we can become a crown jewel of the east San Gabriel Valley</h1>

            <p>
                We have abundant resources in people, property, education and commerce.Thanks to the good work of prior
                counsels and city leaders, we also have a budget surplus that we are already planning to invest in our
                city
                infrastructure and community services. We need to further leverage and develop those resources
                strategically
                and effectively as we continue to improve and develop our downtown, as well as create safe and enjoyable
                neighborhoods throughout the city. I want to see Azusa become a desired destination for our neighbors in
                Southern California, but more importantly a place that all Azusa residents are proud.

                There are excellent opportunities to improve our parks and recreation, our public schools, our areas of
                commerce, our support for the homeless, transportation and much more. We can leverage our future growth
                with smart and thoughtful development as we provide opportunity for more housing, shopping, restaurants
                and entertainment options. Working with our faith community and other partners, we can improve the

                and wellness of our residences and guests as we partner better together in providing various resources
